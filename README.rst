pyarbus
=======

This is pyarbus - eyetracking analysis software written in python.

At the moment, it is very rough and experimental. The intention is to have this
be a software package used for analysis of eyetracking data in general, but at
the moment, it is focused on data generated by SR Research's Eyelink eye
trackers.

This is a for-public-consumption rewrite of previously unreleased internal
code, and it may still contain specifics unique to the way my experiments
(which would be considered a bug and should be removed). Many docstrings have
not yet been updated to reflect the changes introduced by the rewrite.

If you have any questions, my email addres is ``pi berkeley edu`` with the
appropriate characters replacing the spaces.

best,
    Paul Ivanov
