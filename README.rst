pyarbus
=======

This is pyarbus - eyetracking analysis software written in python.

At the moment, it is very rough and experimental. The intention is to have this
be a software package used for analysis of eyetracking data in general, but at
the moment, it is focused on data generated by SR Research's Eyelink eye
trackers.

This is a for-public-consumption rewrite of previously unreleased internal
code, and it may still contain specifics unique to the way my experiments
(which would be considered a bug and should be removed). Many docstrings have
not yet been updated to reflect the changes introduced by the rewrite.

Right now, 2011-10-18, pyarbus depends on `nitime`_ from Git.

.. _nitime: http://github.com/nipy/nitime

To start using pyarbus right away, just run::
    
    python setup.py develop

This will make it so that you don't have to reinstall every time you pull in
new changes from the git repository. If you just wante to install
