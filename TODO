right now, some of what we do is cached in memeory (thanks to the
one-time-properties)

it'd be nice to use joblib to store computations on disk
    - this might make sense for the computation expensive parts, not for just
    reading ascii data by itself

what about computing saccades using different algorithms, and caching those
results, so as to be able to quickly switch between them?

API Docs building, as well as a proper manual

Examples of customized extensions via subclassing of Eye and Eyelink classes
(like I did for JoV paper)

release the current git version of nitime, so that users have an easier time
meeting the requirements
