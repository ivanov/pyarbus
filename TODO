right now, some of what we do is cached in memeory (thanks to the
one-time-properties)

it'd be nice to use joblib to store computations on disk
    - this might make sense for the computation expensive parts, not for just
    reading ascii data by itself

what about computing saccades using different algorithms, and caching those
results, so as to be able to quickly switch between them?
